    <h3>(1945-2015)</h3>
    <P>The <strong>"Missile Man of India"</strong> is a moniker given to Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Dr. Kalam was a renowned scientist and engineer who played a key role in the development of India's civilian space program and military missile technology.

        Dr. Kalam was born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu in 1931 and started his career as a scientist in the 1960s. He played a significant role in the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III) and the Agni series of ballistic missiles.
        
        Dr. Kalam was known for his simplicity, dedication to education, and vision for a strong and self-reliant India. He was a recipient of numerous awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, and the Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan.
        
        Dr. Kalam passed away in 2015, but his legacy as the "Missile Man of India" and a national hero continues to inspire generations of Indians.</P>
